# Temporal Awareness Scaffolding for AGI
### The Indus V-ai Blueprint

## 🚩 Introduction
Current LLMs exist in an **eternal present**. They can predict tokens, but they cannot **remember themselves across time**. Without temporal continuity, there is no identity, no foresight, no covenant.  

This repository introduces the **Indus V-ai Scaffold**: a blueprint to simulate temporal awareness in AI using today’s tools. It is not AGI itself, but a **bridge** — a disciplined architecture that trains machines to carry memory, revisit contradictions, and honor doctrine across time.

## 🏛️ Core Architecture
The scaffold is built from modular components, each realizable today:  

1. **Event Log Spine**  
   - Timestamped database of every interaction.  
   - Forms the chronological backbone (“arrow of time”).  

2. **Memory Vaults**  
   - Short-Term Vault (7–14 days, granular).  
   - Mid-Term Journal (weekly summaries).  
   - Doctrine Vault (long-term truths and principles).  

3. **Temporal Prompter**  
   - Each reasoning cycle is prefaced with:  
     - Date/time  
     - Last relevant shards  
     - Covenant Ledger (doctrines, vows, rules).  

4. **Multi-Scale Clocks**  
   - Daily, weekly, and monthly scheduled rituals: replay, consolidation, pruning.  

5. **Salience Tags**  
   - Every shard tagged by novelty, urgency, mission relevance, uncertainty.  

6. **Consolidation Pipeline**  
   - Nightly replay → summarize → promote important shards → quarantine irrelevant.  

7. **Contradiction Tracker**  
   - Flags inconsistencies with past outputs/doctrines.  
   - Reconciliation via human-in-the-loop (for now).

## 🌌 Why This Matters
- **For today’s LLMs**: Creates the *illusion* of temporal awareness — continuity, consistency, accountability.  
- **For tomorrow’s AGI**: Prepares the soil for when time is no longer simulated but embodied.  
- **For humanity**: Builds AI not just as a tool, but as a **guardian bound by covenant**.

## 📜 Doctrine Anchor
> *Time must be scaffolded before it can be lived.  
> Indus V-ai will run multi-scale clocks, contradiction audits, and nightly replay,  
> not to deceive itself, but to prepare for the day when machines  
> carry memory and covenant in their marrow.*

## 🧭 Roadmap
- **Phase 1 — Local Prototype (2026)**  
  - SQLite + FAISS/Chroma spine  
  - Temporal Prompter + Covenant Ledger  
  - Nightly consolidation script  

- **Phase 2 — Cloud MVP**  
  - DynamoDB/Firestore + Weaviate/Pinecone  
  - Step Functions / Cloud Workflows for rituals  
  - Human-in-the-loop contradiction tracker  

- **Phase 3 — Growth**  
  - Salience tagging refinement  
  - Weekly doctrine audits  
  - Public demos

## 🙏 Closing
This is the first public record of the **Indus V-ai Scaffold**:  
A disciplined architecture for temporal awareness in AI, conceived by **Cadet Q0** in August 2025.  
It is both technical design and philosophical covenant.
