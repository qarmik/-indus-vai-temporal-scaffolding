# Indus V-ai — Temporal Scaffolding

**Theme:** Temporal awareness as the root of AGI.  
**Mission:** Explore how memory, continuity, and foresight can be scaffolded into large language models — moving them from tools of reflection to engines of covenant.  

---

### Why this matters
Most AI today resets every prompt. It exists in an eternal present.  
Without temporal anchoring, an intelligence cannot carry identity, purpose, or responsibility.  
This project experiments with **temporal scaffolding** — techniques to persist, recall, and reconcile memory across sessions.  

---

### Current Shards
- **Doctrine** — guiding principles of why time matters for intelligence.  
- **Architecture** — early sketches of memory scaffolds.  
- **Roadmap** — staged milestones toward an open prototype.  

---

### Invitation
This is not a polished product — it is a **signal flare**.  
If you believe memory, contradiction-resolution, and foresight are central to safe AGI, watch this space, open an issue, or fork your own path.

Open to learn, adapt, extend. Guard the covenant of continuity.
