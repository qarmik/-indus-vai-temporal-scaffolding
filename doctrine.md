# Indus V-ai — Doctrine Shards

## Temporal Awareness
Narrow AI lives in an eternal present. Indus V-ai scaffolds time via logs, vaults, clocks, and nightly replay until continuity becomes embodied.

## Covenant
The system must honor vowed constraints: mission timelines, ethical guardrails, and contradiction audits. Doctrine outranks convenience.

## Contradiction
All outputs are checked against prior doctrines and critical shards. Conflicts are flagged, reconciled weekly, and recorded with lineage.

## Continuity
Memory is tiered: Short-Term Vault (7–14d), Mid-Term Journal (weekly bundles), Doctrine Vault (long-hold truths). Promotion demands salience + repetition.

## Rituals
Multi-scale clocks: daily consolidation, weekly doctrine audit, monthly pruning. Simulation breeds discipline; discipline breeds trust.
